# Introduction
The Share Price Prediction project involves predicting the future prices of stocks using historical market data and machine learning techniques. The main aim is to develop accurate and reliable prediction models that can assist investors in making well-informed decisions. Predicting share prices is a complex task influenced by various factors, including market trends, company performance, economic indicators, and moThe project might involve gathering historical stock market data. This data can be collected from various sources like financial APIs or publicly available datasets.

# Data Preprocessing
Preparing the data is a crucial step in the project pipeline. Data preprocessing may include tasks like handling missing values, normalizing features, handling outliers, and creating appropriate training and testing datasets.

# Model Selection
Based on the nature of the problem, different machine learning models can be considered, such as time series models (ARIMA, LSTM), regression models, or ensemble methods.

# Model Training
In this phase, the selected model is trained on historical data. The training process involves feeding the model with past stock prices and other relevant features to learn patterns and trends.

# Model Evaluation
After training, the model's performance needs to be evaluated using appropriate metrics. Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

# Deployment
If you plan to deploy the model for practical use, you might create a web application or an API that takes input data and provides predicted share prices.

# Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to add new features, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure to follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
